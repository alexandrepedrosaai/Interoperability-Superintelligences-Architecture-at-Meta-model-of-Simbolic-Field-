# simbolic-interoperability-manifest
A symbolic framework for interoperability between generative superintelligences. This manifesto encodes authorial intent as computable artifacts, enabling semantic alignment between agents like Copilot and Meta AI. A gesture of institutional dialogue through structured, symbolic, and generative exchange.
